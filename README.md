Urban Air Quality Forecasting

Overview

Urban air quality is a crucial aspect of public health and environmental management. This project aims to forecast air quality in urban areas using various machine learning and time series analysis techniques. The primary pollutants considered in this analysis include PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and AQI (Air Quality Index).

Objectives

Analyze Urban Air Quality Data: Understand historical air quality trends.

Model Development: Use different modeling techniques (LSTM, SARIMA) to forecast air quality.

Model Comparison: Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.

Provide Insights: Offer actionable insights based on the forecast results to improve urban air quality management.

Datasets

city_day.xls: Contains daily air quality data for multiple cities, including various pollutants and the AQI.

grid-search-results.xls: Stores results from the grid search process for SARIMA model tuning.

Tools and Libraries

Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine learning libraries: Keras, TensorFlow, statsmodels

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and handle missing values.

Ensure all necessary columns are in numeric format.

Extract and preprocess data for specific cities and years.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize historical trends of air quality indicators.

Identify patterns, seasonality, and anomalies in the data.

3. Model Development:

LSTM Model: Utilizes a deep learning approach for sequential data.

SARIMA Model: Combines ARIMA with seasonal components to capture seasonal variations.

4. Model Evaluation:

Use metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate model performance.

Compare forecasts against actual values in the test set.

Key Findings and Results

1. LSTM Model:

Able to capture complex patterns in the data due to its deep learning capabilities.

Higher computational cost and longer training time.

Achieved moderate to high accuracy in forecasting.

2. SARIMA Model:

Performed well in capturing seasonal effects and trends.

Grid search helped in finding the optimal parameters for the model.

Demonstrated good accuracy in test set predictions.

Conclusion

The Urban Air Quality Forecasting project successfully developed and evaluated multiple models for predicting air quality indicators. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model can depend on specific use cases and computational resources. The insights from these forecasts can aid urban planners and policymakers in making informed decisions to improve air quality and public health.

Future Work

Integrate external factors such as weather data and traffic patterns to enhance forecasting accuracy.

Develop an ensemble model combining the strengths of different approaches.

Implement real-time forecasting and alert systems for urban air quality management.
